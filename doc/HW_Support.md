The package contains the precompiled X2Cscope libraries for the most popular [Microchip MCUs](https://www.microchip.com/mcu). You can use these libs to integrate X2Cscope tool to your custom/bare metal application.


X2Cscope implementation is using dynamic function pointers. Some of our low-end 8bit MCUs does not support it.
