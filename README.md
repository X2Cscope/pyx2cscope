# pyX2Cscope
- pyX2Cscope is the Python implementation of the X2Cscope plugin from MPLABX.
- This will let the user use the functionality of X2Cscope even outside mplabx enviroment / Standalone.
- It allows user to:
  - Automated Unit Tests (TDD) using pytest
  - BDD(behaviour driven development), Framework: "Cucumber"
  - Different user interface
  - Data collection for machine learning and training models
  - Run-Time data analysis
  - Use of Real Time AI model
  - HiL(Hardware in the loop) testing and tuning

## Getting Started with Scripting

1. You can install the module using pip: <br>`pip install pyx2cscope`
2. Go to the `Examples` directory in the pyX2Cscope project to check out the available examples or create a new .py file according to your requirements.
3. start with importing pyX2Cscope:  `import pyx2cscope`
4. Choose the communication interface from the interfaces' module. Currently, **Only Serial** is supported: CAN and LIN coming in near future: <br> 
```
from xc2scope import X2CScope
``` 
5. Initiate the X2CScope and provide the desired COM port, by default baud rate is set to **_115200_**. . If there's a need to change the baud rate, include the baud_rate parameter with your preferred baud rate, In the same way other setting could be made:
```
x2cScope = X2CScope(port="COM16", elf_file=elf_file)
```  
6. Replace the **elf_file** with the path to the ELF file of your project.
7. Create a Variable object for the variable you want to monitor:
```
variable = x2cScope.get_variable('Variable_name')
```
8. Replace 'Variable_name' with the name of the variable you want to monitor. You can create multiple variable objects as required. 
9. Once you have gone through these steps, you can use the **get_value()** function to retrieve the value of the variable:
``` 
variable.get_value() 
```
10. To set the value for the respective variable **set_value()**:
```
variable.set_value(value)
```
# Scope Functionality
1. To use the scope functionality, add channel to the scope: **add_scope_channel(variable: Variable)** : 
```
x2cScope.add_scope_channel(variable1)
x2cScope.add_scope_channel(variable2)
```
2. To remove channel: **remove_scope_channel(variable: Variable)**:
```
x2cScope.remove_scope_channel(variable2)
```
3. Up to 8 channels can be added. 
4. To Set up Trigger, any available variable can be selected, by default works on no trigger configuration.
```
x2cscope.set_scope_trigger(variable: Variable, trigger_level: int, trigger_mode: int, trigger_delay: int, trigger_edge: int)
```
5. ##### Trigger Parameters:
```
srcChannel: TriggerChannel (variable)
Level: trigger_level
Trigger_mode: 1 for triggered, 0 for Auto (No trigger)
Trigger_delay = Value > 0 Pre-trigger, Value < 0 Post trigger
Trigger_Edge: Rising (1) or Falling (0)
```
#### Example
```
x2cScope.set_scope_trigger(variable3, trigger_level=500, trigger_mode=1, trigger_delay=50, trigger_edge=1)
```

6. ##### **clear_trigger()**: Clears and diable trigger
```
x2cscope.clear_trigger()
```
7. #### **set_sample_time(sample_time: int)**: This paramater defines a pre-scaler when the scope is in the sampling mode. This can be used to extend total sampling time at cost of resolution. 0 = every sample, 1 = every 2nd sample, 2 = every 3rd sample .....
```
x2cScope.set_sample_time(2)
```
8. #### is_scope_data_ready(self) -> bool: Returns Scope sampling state. Returns: true if sampling has completed, false if itâ€™s yet in progress.  
```
while not x2cScope.is_scope_data_ready():
    time.sleep(0.1)
```
9. #### get_scope_channel_data(valid_data=False) -> Dict[str, List[Number]]: Once sampling is completed, this function could be used to get the sampled data.
```
data = x2cScope.get_scope_channel_data()
```
10. #### This data now could be used according to the preference. 

## Getting Started with pyX2Cscope reference GUI

1. pyX2Cscope-GUI is based on Serial interface.
2. The Firmware of the microcontroller should have the X2Cscope library/Peripheral enabled.
2. Select the COM Port, Baud Rate from the drop-down menus and the ELF file of the project, the microcontroller programmed with. <br>

    ![COM-port](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/X2Cscope/pyx2cscope/develop/pyx2cscope/gui/img/Setting.jpg?token=GHSAT0AAAAAACGXT7TO3SXCYEGFM35GEU52ZHIPW5Q)
3. Sample time can be changed during run time as well, by default its set to 500ms.
4. Press on **Connect**
5. Once the connection between pyX2Cscope and Microcontroller takes place, the buttons will be enabled.
