# PyX2CScope-GUI
- PyX2CScope is the Python implementation of the X2Cscope plugin from MPLABX.

## Getting Started

1. PyX2Cscope-GUI is based on Serial interface.
2. The Firmware of the microcontroller should have the X2CScope library/Peripheral enabled.
2. Select the COM Port, Baud Rate from the drop-down menus and the ELF file of the project, the microcontroller programmed with. <br>
